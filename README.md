# Employee-Salary-Prediction-App-Mohit-Kumar-Gupta
💼 Employee Salary Prediction & Classification✨ Project OverviewThis project presents an advanced machine learning solution designed to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000 or not, based on various demographic and professional attributes. Leveraging the UCI Adult Census Dataset, this application demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to model training, evaluation, and deployment as an interactive web application.The core of this project is a robust classification model that provides accurate insights into salary brackets, which can be valuable for socio-economic analysis, policy-making, or even personal career planning.Live Demo: Access the deployed application here!🚀 FeaturesInteractive Web Application: Built with Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for individual predictions.Batch Prediction: Upload a CSV file for bulk predictions and download the results.Comprehensive Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and categorical feature encoding.Multiple Model Evaluation: Compares the performance of various classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting).Best Model Selection: Automatically identifies and utilizes the best-performing model (Gradient Boosting Classifier) for predictions.Detailed Performance Metrics: Displays accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix for model transparency.Clear Visualizations: Uses matplotlib and seaborn for insightful data visualizations and model performance comparison.📊 DatasetThe project utilizes the UCI Adult Census Dataset, which contains over 48,000 instances with 14 attributes. These attributes include:age: Age of the individual.workclass: Type of employer (e.g., Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Federal-gov).fnlwgt: Final weight (census-specific, represents the number of people the census believes the entry represents).education: Highest level of education achieved (e.g., Bachelors, HS-grad, Some-college).educational-num: Numerical representation of education level.marital-status: Marital status (e.g., Married-civ-spouse, Never-married, Divorced).occupation: Type of occupation (e.g., Tech-support, Craft-repair, Exec-managerial).relationship: Relationship within the household (e.g., Husband, Own-child, Not-in-family).race: Race of the individual (e.g., White, Black, Asian-Pac-Islander).gender: Gender of the individual (Male, Female).capital-gain: Capital gains from investments.capital-loss: Capital losses from investments.hours-per-week: Number of hours worked per week.native-country: Country of origin.income: Target variable, indicating if income is >50K or <=50K.🛠 Technology StackPython: Core programming language.Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.NumPy: For numerical operations.Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development, training, and evaluation.Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.Streamlit: For creating the interactive web application.Joblib: For saving and loading the trained machine learning model.⚙️ Installation & SetupTo run this project locally, follow these steps:Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/Mohit-Kumar-Gupta-19/Employee-Salary-Prediction-App-Mohit-Kumar-Gupta.git
